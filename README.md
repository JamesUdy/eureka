Understand and break down large classes without breaking a sweat ðŸ˜“

## Quick start

Build the project first and then run the command line tool.

```bash
$ twd view io.redgreen.ExampleClass
```

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram.

For more options, run `twd --help`.

## Known issues

- The tool does not work well with classes with lambda expressions and anonymous classes. This is something I am working
  on actively to fix. This has to do with the special characters in the class names and
  the [edge bundling graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bilevel-edge-bundling) source code that I am using.

- Kotlin classes have synthetic methods that are not visible in the source code. These methods are shown in the
  diagram. This is yet another limitation of the tool at the moment.
