# Tumbleweed (early preview) ![CI](https://github.com/legacycodehq/tumbleweed/actions/workflows/jvm-tests.yml/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/legacycodehq/tumbleweed)

Effortlessly understand and analyze Kotlin/Java classes in your codebase ðŸ˜Ž

## Is this for me?

- You constantly feel that there's something off with the design but can't articulate it well to your team members.
- You have joined a new team or an organization and want to understand the codebase.
- You have this one class that you can't understand because it's way too large, and the previous maintainers have
  left the team or organization.
- You want to contribute to an open-source project to build your portfolio.
- You are curious about how well your codebase is designed and want to know how you could improve it.
- You are refactoring a class and want to identify clusters so that you can extract them into smaller classes.
- You want to analyze the codebase to identify code smells and refactor them.

If you have any of these requirements, then this tool is for you ðŸ˜‰

## Live demo

You can try this [sample interactive graph](https://redgreenio.github.io/) for Signal Android
App's [StoryViewerPageFragment](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/ff8f9ca81ae6a25e1e946612c817206b9410d9a1/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/stories/viewer/page/StoryViewerPageFragment.kt)
class.

## Features

### 1. Class visualization

You must build the project first and then run the tool.

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram. The diagram
will be updated in real-time as you make changes to the source code and compile the project.

For more options, run `twd watch --help`.

#### 1.1 Android support (experimental)

```bash
twd watch -x android MediaPreviewActivity
```

Read [this blog post](https://legacycode.com/android-support) to learn how to use this feature when examining Android
classes.

#### 1.2 Without Android support

```bash
twd watch MediaPreviewActivity
```

### 2. File ownership (experimental)

![Treemap](docs/images/ownership.png)

#### Usage

```bash
twd ownership --repo <path-to-git-repo>
```

The command will start a web server on port 7080. Visit the URL on `localhost:7080`.

After visiting the app, update the URL on the address bar to find the ownership information for the target file.

For example,

```
http://localhost:7080/?file=cli/src/../OwnershipCommand.kt
```

The `file` query parameter should use the full path of the target file.

## Installation

```bash
brew install legacycodehq/tap/twd
```

## Updates

```bash
brew upgrade twd
```
