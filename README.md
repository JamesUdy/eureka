# Tumbleweed (early preview)

Effortlessly understand large (and small) Kotlin/Java classes ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

```bash
$ brew tap redgreenio/tap

$ brew install twd
```

## Updates

```bash
$ brew upgrade twd
```

## Quick start

Build the project first and then run the command line tool.

```bash
$ twd watch io.redgreen.ExampleClass
```

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram.

The diagram will be updated in real-time as you make changes to the source code and compile the project.

For more options, run `twd watch --help`.

## Dev commands

Tumbleweed is under development. The current reference for production use is making the tool as accurate
as [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org/). Sometimes, we have to process a lot of data to understand the gap between
these two.

The following commands are useful for development and once the project attains version one status, we'll hide these
commands from users but may still continue to use them for developing Tumbleweed.

### json

```bash
$ twd json ExampleClass
```

This command will print the JSON representation of the class to the console. This is the data that is used to render the
[bilevel edge bundling](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bilevel-edge-bundling) graph
on [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com).

### view

```bash
$ twd view my-class.json
```

This command will start a web server and visualize the specified JSON file in the browser. It is best used when
comparing a class visualization using Tumbleweed and a JSON file derived for the same class using jQAssistant.

### convert

```bash
$ twd convert jqassistant-query-result.csv
```

Converts class member relationships query result from jQAssistant to JSON format that can be visualized by Tumbleweed.

### diff

```bash
$ twd diff -b jqassistant-graph.json -i tumbleweed-graph.json.json
```

Compares the graph generated by jQAssistant and Tumbleweed and prints a result showcasing the differences.

## Known issues

- Kotlin synthetic functions are also visible in the diagram.
