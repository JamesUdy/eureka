Effortlessly understand and analyze Kotlin/Java classes in your codebase ðŸ˜Ž

## Is this for me?

- You constantly feel that there's something off with the design but can't articulate it well to your team members.
- You have joined a new team or an organization and want to understand the codebase.
- You have this one class that you can't understand because it's way too large, and the previous maintainers have
  left the team or organization.
- You want to contribute to an open-source project to build your portfolio.
- You are curious about how well your codebase is designed and want to know how you could improve it.
- You are refactoring a class and want to identify clusters so that you can extract them into smaller classes.
- You want to analyze the codebase to identify code smells and refactor them.

If you have any of these requirements, then this tool is for you ðŸ˜‰

## Live demo

You can try this [sample interactive graph](https://redgreenio.github.io/) for Signal Android
App's [StoryViewerPageFragment](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/ff8f9ca81ae6a25e1e946612c817206b9410d9a1/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/stories/viewer/page/StoryViewerPageFragment.kt)
class.

## Installation

```bash
brew install legacycodehq/tap/twd
```

## Updates

```bash
brew upgrade twd
```

## Quick start

Build the project first and then run the command line tool.

```bash
twd watch com.legacycode.ExampleClass
```

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram.

The diagram will be updated in real-time as you make changes to the source code and compile the project.

For more options, run `twd watch --help`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
