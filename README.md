# Tumbleweed (early preview) ![CI](https://github.com/legacycodehq/tumbleweed/actions/workflows/jvm-tests.yml/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/legacycodehq/tumbleweed)

Effortlessly understand and analyze Kotlin/Java classes in your codebase ðŸ˜Ž

## Is this for me?

- You constantly feel that there's something off with the design but can't articulate it well to your team members.
- You have joined a new team or an organization and want to understand the codebase.
- You have this one class that you can't understand because it's way too large, and the previous maintainers have
  left the team or organization.
- You want to contribute to an open-source project to build your portfolio.
- You are curious about how well your codebase is designed and want to know how you could improve it.
- You are refactoring a class and want to identify clusters so that you can extract them into smaller classes.
- You want to analyze the codebase to identify code smells and refactor them.

If you have any of these requirements, then this tool is for you ðŸ˜‰

## Live demo

You can try this [sample interactive graph](https://redgreenio.github.io/) for Signal Android
App's [StoryViewerPageFragment](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/ff8f9ca81ae6a25e1e946612c817206b9410d9a1/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/stories/viewer/page/StoryViewerPageFragment.kt)
class.

## Installation

```bash
brew install legacycodehq/tap/twd
```

## Updates

```bash
brew upgrade twd
```

## Quick start

Build the project first and then run the command line tool.

```bash
twd watch com.legacycode.ExampleClass
```

The command will start a web server on port 7070. Go to `localhost:7070` in your browser to see the diagram.

The diagram will be updated in real-time as you make changes to the source code and compile the project.

For more options, run `twd watch --help`.
